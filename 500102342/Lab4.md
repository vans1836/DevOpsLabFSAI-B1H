# *GIT Branching / Merge / Rebase*

## 1. *Creating Directories and Files:*

- **mkdir project**: Creates a project directory.
- **cd project**: Navigates into the project directory.
- **mkdir src**: Creates a src directory inside the project directory.
- **touch README.md**: Creates a README.md file.
- **touch z.txt**: Creates a z.txt file in featureA branch.
- **touch x.txt**: Creates a x.txt file in featureA branch.
- **touch s.txt**: Creates a s.txt file in main branch.

## 2. *Working with Files:*

- **echo "Hello World" >> README.md**: Adds "Hello World" to README.md.
- **echo "content" >> README.md && cat README.md**: Appends content to README.md and displays it:
  
  
  Hello World 1
  content
  
  
- **echo -e "hello \n me"**: Correctly prints the string with a newline:
  
  
  hello
  me
  
  
- **echo "Hello World 1" > README.md**: Rewrites README.md with "Hello World 1".

## 3. *Git Commands:*

- **git init**: Initializes a new Git repository.
- **git remote -v**: Displays remote repositories (none added here).
- **git status**: Shows the status of files in the repository.
- **git add .**: Stages all changes in the directory.
- **git commit -m "message"**: Commits staged changes with a message.
- **git log**: Displays commit history.

## 4. *Branching and Switching:*

- **git branch**: Lists branches in the repository.
- **git branch -M main**: Renames the current branch to main.
- **git checkout featureA**: Switches to the featureA branch.
- **git branch featureA**: Creates a featureA branch.
- **git checkout -b featureB**: Creates and switches to featureB.
- **git checkout main**: Switches to the main branch.

## 5. *Git Operations:*

- **git reset --soft <commit>**: Resets to a previous commit without changing the working directory.
- **git rebase main**: Rebases the featureA branch onto the main branch.
- **git merge featureB**: Merges the featureB branch into the main branch.
- **git reset --hard <commit>**: Resets the working directory and commit history to a specific commit.
- **git merge --squash featureB**: Squashes all the commits from featureB into a single commit without updating the HEAD.

## 6. *Final Content of Files:*

- **README.md**:
  
  Hello World 1
  content
  
  
- **z.txt** (created in featureA branch): Empty initially but added and committed.
- **x.txt** (created in featureA branch): Empty initially but added and committed.
- **b.txt**: Added in the main branch with commit message "Added b.txt".
- **s.txt**: Added in the main branch with commit message "s file added in main".
