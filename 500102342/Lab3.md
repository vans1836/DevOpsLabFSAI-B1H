# *Git Basics*

## *Using SSH and HTTP for Git*

### *SSH Key Setup*

Using SSH ensures secure access to Git repositories by utilizing both public and private keys.

---

### *1. Generating an SSH Key*
Generate an SSH key by running the following command:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "saxenajaanhvii@gmail.com"
```

Verify the key is generated at the default location:
```sh
ls ~/.ssh
```

---

### *2. Viewing the SSH Key*
To read the SSH key, use the following command:
```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

---

### *3. Adding the SSH Key to the SSH-Agent*
```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

---

### *4. Adding the Key to GitHub*
- Navigate to *GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys → Add a new key*.
- Copy and paste the contents of id_ed25519.pub.

---

### *Cloning a Repository Using SSH*
```sh
git clone git@github.com:jahnaviichauhan/DemoMain.git
```

---

### *Cloning a Repository Using HTTP*
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jahnaviichauhan/DemoMain.git
```

When using HTTP, Git will prompt for your credentials if authentication is required.

---

## *Git Workflow*

### *1. Initialize and Clone a Repository*
```sh
git init
git clone <repository-url>
```

---

### *2. Working on a Repository*
1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. Make necessary changes.
3. Add changes to the staging area:
```sh
git add .
```

4. Commit changes with a descriptive message:
```sh
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

---

### *3. Resolving Merge Conflicts*
To avoid merge conflicts, always pull the latest changes before pushing:
```sh
git pull origin main
git merge
```

Push the changes to the repository:
```sh
git push origin main
```

---

## *VIM Commands (for Git commit messages)*

```sh
1. i → Insert mode
2. q → Quit
3. esc → Changing modes
4. shift + v → Visual mode
   - y → Copy / shift + insert
   - p → Paste
5. ‘H’, ‘J’, ‘K’, ‘L’ → Move left, up, down, right
6. dd → Delete the line
7. u → Undo
8. /something → Search something
9. esc + :wq → Save and quit
```
