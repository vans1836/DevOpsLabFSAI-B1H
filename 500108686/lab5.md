# **Git Submodules**

## **Git Workflow for Multiple Repositories and Submodules**

This session involves:

- Cloning multiple repositories
- Creating files
- Adding and committing changes
- Setting up Git submodules
- Pushing updates to remote repositories

---

## **Step 1: Cloning Repositories**

You cloned three repositories from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vans1836/DemoMain.git
git clone https://github.com/vans1836/DemoCSS.git
git clone https://github.com/vans1836/DemoJS.git
```

ðŸ’¡ *Note:* There was an error (`gir clone` instead of `git clone`).

---

## **Step 2: Creating Files in Each Repository**

### In `DemoJS` repository:
```sh
cd DemoJS
touch script.js
```

### In `DemoCSS` repository:
```sh
cd ../DemoCSS
touch style.css
```

### In `DemoMain` repository:
```sh
cd ../DemoMain
touch index.html
```

---

## **Step 3: Committing and Pushing Changes**

For each repository, you added, committed, and pushed the files.

### For `DemoMain`
Earliest to latest commits:
```sh
git add .
# 1st commit
git commit -m "Added basic website HTML file"
# 2nd commit
git commit -m "this is a commit"
# 3rd commit
git commit -m "Path added"
# 4th commit
git commit -m "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/vans1836/DemoMain"
# 5th commit
git commit -m "made a change in index.html style.css"
# 6th commit
git commit -m "css folder deleted"
# 7th commit
git commit -m "Added CSS folder"
# 8th commit
git commit -m "sync"

git push
```

### For `DemoJS`
Earliest to latest commits:
```sh
git add .
# 1st commit
git commit -m "Added script.js"
# 2nd commit
git commit -m "Js"
# 3rd commit
git commit -m "js configured"

git push
```

### For `DemoCSS`
Earliest to latest commits:
```sh
git add .
# 1st commit
git commit -m "css file"
# 2nd commit
git commit -m "folder"
# 3rd commit
git commit -m "CSS"
# 4th commit
git commit -m "css changed backgroundcolor"

git push
```

---

## **Step 4: Setting Up Git Submodules**

You added `DemoCSS` and `DemoJS` as submodules inside `DemoMain`:

```sh
git submodule add git@github.com:vans1836/DemoCSS.git css
git submodule add git@github.com:vans1836/DemoJS.git js
```

Then, you committed and pushed the changes:

```sh
git commit -m "added css to main"
git push
```

```sh
git commit -m "added js to main"
git push
```

---

## **Step 5: Verifying Repository Status**

Checking the status:

```sh
git status
```
---

## **Explanation of the Workflow**

This document demonstrates a structured approach to managing multiple repositories with Git submodules. The key steps include:

1. **Cloning Repositories:** Downloading code from remote repositories to the local environment.
2. **File Creation:** Establishing required files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) in respective repositories.
3. **Commit Management:** Accurate and sequential commit messages reflect project history transparently.
4. **Submodule Integration:** Adding external repositories (`DemoCSS`, `DemoJS`) as submodules in `DemoMain` for modular project management.
5. **Verification of Status:** Using `git status` to ensure the working directory is clean and ready for future development.
